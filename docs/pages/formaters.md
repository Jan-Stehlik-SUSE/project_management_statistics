# Formatters

The formatters allow to convert a result from the metrics to an specific format.

Currently, the following formats are supported:

- InfluxDB input line format
- CSV
- JSON

Use the static method format to convert a MetricsResult (result from metrics queries)
into the format recognized by influxdb, CSV, or JSON for populating a database or other systems.
